    "# Data Munging\n",
    "The term **mung** is a technical term that was coined about half a century ago by students of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Munging means to change, in a series of well-specified and reversible steps, a piece of original data to a completely different (and hopefully more useful) one. Deep-rooted in hacker culture, munging is often described in the data science pipeline using other, almost synonymous, terms such as *data wrangling* or *data preparation*.\n"
